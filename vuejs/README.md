# Step 2

This second step focuses on the communication with API.

- Make api call to this url (https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=API_KEY) to get the latest headlines from different sources
- Show the latest headlines in the UI
- Make another api call to this url (https://newsapi.org/v2/sources?apiKey=API_KEY
) to get the list of sources & show the sources as a dropdown to filter button in the top right corner
- When a user filter a source then show the headlines from that perticular source by filtering the data.
- Use vuex for the state management
